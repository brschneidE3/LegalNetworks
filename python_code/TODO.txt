    ## THEORY ##
    - IAIN: Look into Python graph-theory packages and decide if any of them are sufficiently similar to what we want
        -Do we want to start with a baseline package and then make our own addition?
        -Do we want to build from scratch?
    - IAIN: As it becomes clear what kind of analytic functionality we need to build, accumulate a list of functions
        and functionality to work on

    ## IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO ##
    - Confirm that all current code is pep8 approved
