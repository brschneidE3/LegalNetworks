North Carolina, Western Division.</b></p></center>\n<center>August 27, 2007.</center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*788</span> Ta-Letta Bryant Saunders, Bryant Saunders PLLC, Raleigh, NC, for Plaintiff.</p>\n<p>Angela B. Cummings, Julie Kerr Adams, L. Stanford Sherrill, Jr., Littler Mendelson, PC, Charlotte, NC, for Defendant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ORDER</h2>\n<p>DEVER, District Judge.</p>\n<p>On February 2, 2007, Daquanta Roberts (\"plaintiff') filed a complaint concerning her employment by Wal-Mart Stores East, Inc. (\"Wal-Mart\"). Plaintiff alleges that Wal-Mart failed to promote her because of her race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. (\"Title VII\") and in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. <i>See</i> Compl. VII 47-50. The complaint also requests \"[a]n Order enjoining defendants from engaging in discrimination on the basis of race in accordance with N.C.G.S. § 143-422.1. . . .\" Compl., Prayer for Relief, 2.</p>\n<p>Wal-Mart moved to dismiss the Title VII claim because plaintiff allegedly did not file her claim within 90 days of her receipt of her right to sue letter. <i>See</i> Def. Mem. 3-5 (analyzing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1)); Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Wal-Mart also moved to dismiss plaintiffs request for relief under N.C. Gen.Stat. § 143-422.1 for failure to state a claim. <i>See</i> Def. Mem. 5-6. Plaintiff responded in opposition, and Wal-Mart replied.</p>\n<p>Wal-Mart's argument concerning the timeliness of plaintiffs Title VII claim is not without force. Nonetheless, the court denies Wal-Mart's motion to dismiss the Title VII claim because a more complete record is needed to resolve Wal-Mart's argument. Specifically, discovery needs to take place concerning the factual issues described in Wal-Mart's memorandum and plaintiffs response. Following discovery, Wal-Mart may (of course) file a motion for summary judgment and challenge whether the Title VII claim was timely filed.</p>\n<p>As for plaintiffs request for relief under N.C. Gen.Stat. § 143-422.1, plaintiff concedes that the North Carolina Supreme Court and the North Carolina Court of Appeals have never recognized a private cause of action under N.C. Gen.Stat. 143-422.1. Pl. Resp. 7. She also appears to recognize that North Carolina appellate decisions citing N.C. Gen.Stat. § 143-422.1 as a source of public policy for a tort claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy have never recognized a tort claim of wrongful failure to promote in violation of public policy. <i>See id.</i> Nevertheless, plaintiff argues that she \"is not asking the court to recognize a private cause of action. She is requesting the court to enjoin the Defendants from engaging in future discrimination based on race in the spirit of [N.C. Gen.Stat. § 143-422.1].\" Pl. Resp. 7-8.</p>\n<p>The court rejects plaintiffs argument. If this court were to grant the requested relief under N.C. Gen.Stat. § 143-422.1, then the court would be creating a private cause of action under N.C. Gen.Stat. § 143-422.1. Such a private cause of action would contradict North Carolina law. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Smith v. First Union Nat'l Bank,</i> 202 F.3d 234, 247 (4th Cir.2000). \"Neither the North Carolina Supreme Court nor the North Carolina Court of`Appeals has recognized a private cause of action under [N.C. Gen.Stat. § 143-422.1]. Instead, most courts have applied [N.C. Gen.Stat. § 143-422.1] only to common law wrongful discharge claims or in connection with other specific statutory remedies.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>McLean v. Patten Cmtys., Inc.,</i> 332 F.3d 714, 719 (4th Cir.2003); <i>Jones v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*789</span> <i>Duke Energy Corp.,</i> 43 Fed.Appx. 599, 600 (4th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (unpublished); <i>Schulze v.

Thus, the court grants Wal-Mart's motion to dismiss plaintiffs request for relief under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-422.1.</p>\n<p>As explained above, the court GRANTS IN PART Wal-Mart's motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs request for relief under N.C. Gen.Stat. § 143-422.1 is DISMISSED. Wal-Mart's motion to dismiss plaintiffs Title VII claim is DENIED.</p>\n<p>SO ORDERED.</p>\n</div>",
