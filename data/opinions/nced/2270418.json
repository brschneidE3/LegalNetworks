North Carolina, Fayetteville Division.</b></p></center>\n<center>July 11, 1983.</center>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1306</span> ORDER</h2>\n<p>BRITT, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs instituted this action on 11 December 1981 alleging damages to property and loss of income as a result of a fire which occurred on 12 December 1980 and which plaintiffs allege was caused by a defective fryer sold by defendant on 13 December 1974. Defendants have moved for summary judgment relying on N.C.Gen. Stat. 1-50(6) which provides that</p>\n<blockquote>No action for the recovery of damages for personal injury, death or damage to property based upon or arising out of any alleged defect or any failure in relation to a product shall be brought more than six years after the date of initial purchase for use or consumption.</blockquote>\n<p>Although the North Carolina Supreme Court has yet to address the validity of this section, it has addressed the validity of N.C.Gen.Stat. 1-50(5)a, a companion provision dealing with defective or unsafe conditions resulting from an improvement to real property, and has found that statute valid. <i>Lamb v. Wedgewood South Corp.,</i> 308 N.C. 419, 302 N.E.2d 868 (1983). In addition, <i>Bolick v. American Barmag Corp.,</i> 306 N.C. 364, 293 S.E.2d 415 (1982), by way of dicta, strongly indicated a similar result for N.C.Gen.Stat. 1-50(6).</p>\n<p>Viewing the statute relied upon by defendants to be a statute of repose and an absolute bar to recovery under the facts as stated in the complaint filed herein, the motion of defendants for summary judgment is allowed. <i>See Tims v. Kerr Lake Country Club, Inc.,</i> No. 83-53-CIV-5 (E.D.N.C. 8 July 1983). This action is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<p>AND IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n</div>",
